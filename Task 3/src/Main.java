/*
Create an interface called AnimalSound.java - declare a method called "makeSound();" in it.

Create Animal.java

give it a private field called numberOfLegs using an appropriate data type.
add a constructor, that sets the above field.
add a getter for the numberOfLegs field.
have it implement the interface AnimalSound
the makeSound() method must print the following: "Undefined animal makes no sound."
Create Zoo.java:

add a Collection of the type Animal called "animals", e.g. an ArrayList (make sure to initialize it).
add a method called makeAllSounds(). This must loop through all elements in the above collection and call the makeSound() on the element.
add a method called addAnimal() that takes in a new Animal as a parameter and adds it to the animals collection.
add a method called printNumberOfLegs() that loops through all elements in the animals collection and sums up the number of legs before printing ("Total number of legs in my zoo: "+legs);
Create animals:

You are to create 3 animals of your own choosing.
Each animal must have their own class that extends the Animal class.
The constructor of each of the animals must take in an int as a parameter (numberOfLegs) and call super(numberOfLegs) in its body.
Two of the animals must @Override the makeSound method, printing a line with what the specific animal sound like. e.g. ("Tiger goes grrrr");
The last animal must not override the makeSound method.
In the Main.java:

Create a new instance of Zoo
Create instances of each of your 3 animals.
Call the zoo.addAnimal() method with each of your 3 animal objects.
Call the zoo.makeSounds() method.
Call the zoo.printNumberOfLegs() method.
