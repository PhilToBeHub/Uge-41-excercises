/*
You are to create 3 animals of your own choosing.
Each animal must have their own class that extends the Animal class.
The constructor of each of the animals must take in an int as a parameter (numberOfLegs) and call super(numberOfLegs) in its body.
Two of the animals must @Override the makeSound method, printing a line with what the specific animal sound like. e.g. ("Tiger goes grrrr");
The last animal must not override the makeSound method.
